Some of the csv files are too big, hence I am not adding them in the submission. To check the result, kindly run the code from the provided folder to obtain the results in the solution folder. 

Run the codes individually to get the csv result files. 

After running all of the codes, run the python file to plot from the csv result files. Some files may not exist, in that case, run the corresponding .cpp program first and then try again.

Thank You
